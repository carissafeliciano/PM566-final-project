    "title": "Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Survival Among Young Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A SEER Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the US, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80-85% of cases. While several studies have investigated racial/ethnic disparities among all lung cancer patients, there is limited data characterizing racial/ethnic disparities among young NSCLC patients (aged â‰¤50 years). This project evaluated whether survival time was associated with race/ethnicity among among young adults (aged 18-50 years) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, this project aimed to determine whether any differences in survival across the racial/ethnic groups could be attributed to differences in the frequency distributions of sex, histologic subtype, and stage at diagnosis. This project utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 Database and included patients aged 18 to 50 years with an incident diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021, first primary malignancy, and residence in California (n = 4427).\nThe full report can be downloaded here [INSERT LINK].\n\n\nInteractive Visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots display the distribution of survival times for each racial/ethnic group. The line within each box represents the median survival time. The upper bound of the box represents the 75th percentile (Q3), and the lower bound of the box represents the 25th percentile (Q1). The upper whisker is the maximum (highest value within 1.5*IQR of Q3), and the lower whisker is the minimum (lowest value within 1.5*IQR of Q1). Points outside the whiskers represent outliers. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nThe median survival time was lowest for the NHB group (11.0 months) and highest for the NHAIAN group (21.5 months). The median survival time was similar for the NHW (19 months), Hispanic (18 months), and NHAPI (19 months) groups. The median survival time is approximately 1.64-1.73x greater for the NHW, Hispanic, and NHAPI groups compared to the NHB group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time with 95% confidence intervals by race/ethnicity and sex. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nNHB females had a significantly lower median survival time than NHW, Hispanic, and NHAPI females. Similarly, NHB males had a significantly lower median survival time than NHW, Hispanic, and NHAPI females. The small sample size of the NHAIAN group (n = 22) limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions about this group. The racial/ethnic disparities in survival time remained after stratification by sex, which suggests that the differences in the distribution of males/females across the different racial/ethnic groups do not explain the differences in survival time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time with 95% confidence intervals by race/ethnicity and stage at diagnosis. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time with 95% confidence intervals by race/ethnicity and histologic diagnosis.\nAmong patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma, it appears that there is no significant difference in median survival time among the groups as the 95% confidence intervals are overlapping. Similarly, among patients with Large Cell Carcinoma, it appears there is no significant difference in median survival among the groups as the 95% confidence are overlapping."
