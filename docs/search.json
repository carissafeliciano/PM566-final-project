    "title": "Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Survival among Young Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A SEER Analysis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the US, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80-85% of cases. While several studies have investigated racial/ethnic disparities among all lung cancer patients, there is limited data characterizing racial/ethnic disparities among young NSCLC patients (aged ≤50 years). This project evaluated whether survival time was associated with race/ethnicity among among young adults (aged 18-50 years) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, this project aimed to determine whether any differences in survival across the racial/ethnic groups could be attributed to differences in the frequency distributions of sex, histological subtype, and stage at diagnosis. This project utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 Database and included patients aged 18 to 50 years with an incident diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021, first primary malignancy, and residence in California (n = 4427).\nThe full report can be downloaded here.\nInstructions on how to access the SEER-17 dataset can be found here.\n\n\nInteractive Visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots display the distribution of survival times for each racial/ethnic group. The line within each box represents the median survival time. The upper bound of the box represents the 75th percentile (Q3), and the lower bound of the box represents the 25th percentile (Q1). The upper whisker is the maximum (highest value within 1.5*IQR of Q3), and the lower whisker is the minimum (lowest value within 1.5*IQR of Q1). Points outside the whiskers represent outliers. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nThe median survival time was lowest for the NHB group (11.0 months) and highest for the NHAIAN group (21.5 months). The median survival time was similar for the NHW (19 months), Hispanic (18 months), and NHAPI (19 months) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time by race/ethnicity and sex. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs). NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nThe median survival time of NHB females (12 months) was significantly lower than that of NHW (21 months), Hispanic (21 months), and NHAPI (25 months) females. Similarly, the median survival time of NHB males (10 months) was significantly lower than that of NHW (17 months), Hispanic (14 months), and NHAPI (15 months) males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time by race/ethnicity and stage at diagnosis. Error bars represent 95% CIs. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nAmong patients with localized cancer at diagnosis, NHB patients had a lower median survival time (43.5 months) than NHW (57.5 months), NHAPI (51 months), and NHAIAN (75 months) patients. However, these differences were not statistically significant as the 95% CIs overlapped. The median survival time for Hispanic patients (40.5 months) was similar to that of NHB patients (43.5 months). Among patients with regional cancer at diagnosis, NHB patients had a lower median survival time (23 months) than NHW (35.5 months), Hispanic (31 months), and NHAPI (45 months) patients. These differences were not statistically significant. Among patients with distant cancer at diagnosis, the median survival time of NHB patients (6 months) was significantly lower than that of NHW (10 months), Hispanic (12 months), and NHAPI (16 months) patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time by race/ethnicity and histological diagnosis. Error bars represent 95% CIs. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nAmong patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, NHB patients had a statistically significantly lower median survival (11 months) than NHW (16 months), Hispanic (16 months), and NHAPI (21 months) patients. Among patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, NHB patients had a lower median survival (10 months) than NHW (13.5 months) and NHAPI (11.5 months). However, this difference was not statistically significant. Among patients with a histological diagnosis of NOS, NHB patients (12.5 months) had a statistically significantly lower median survival than NHW (37.5 months) and Hispanic (30 months). NHB patients had a lower median survival (12.5 months) than NHAPI patients (18.5 months) as well, but this difference appeared to be not statistically significant. Less than 3% of patients from each group were diagnosed with large cell carcinoma. The small sample size of this subgroup limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions, as reflected by the wide 95% CIs."

    "text": "Data Acquisition and Wrangling\nThe data was extracted from the SEER-17 database, which covers approximately 26.5% of the US population (6). The SEER Stat program was used to access the SEER-17 dataset. The SEER Stat program was used to filter for cases that met the following criteria: incident diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021, aged 18 to 50 years at the time of diagnosis, first primary malignancy, and residence in California.\nThe SEER 17 dataset includes cancer cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2021. Our analysis was restricted to cases diagnosed between 2011 and 2021 to ensure the evidence was relatively recent and relevant. Cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were identified using primary site codes and histology ICD-O-3 codes, as described by Hansen et al. and Ganti et al., respectively (7, 8). The primary site codes were C34.0 (Main bronchus), C34.1 (Upper lobe, lung), C34.2 (Middle lobe, lung), C34.3 (Lower lobe, lung), C34.8 (Overlapping lesion of lung), and C34.9 (Lung, NOS). The histology ICD-O-3 codes are listed below.\nUsing the SEER Stat program, 40 variables were extracted, including demographics, staging, treatment, and survival. The resulting dataset was exported from the SEER Stat program as a csv file and then uploaded into R. Once in R, seven variables relevant to the primary question were selected: “Age recode with single ages and 90+”, “Year of diagnosis”, Sex”, “Race and origin recode (NHW, NHB, NHAIAN, NHAPI, Hispanic)”, “Histologic Type ICD-O-3”, “Combined Summary Stage (2004+)”, and “Survival months”.\nThe key variables were renamed to streamline coding. The survival months, age, and ICD-O-3 variables were converted from characters to integers. Prior to converting the age variable, the text “years” was removed from each value. The “race and origin” variable was converted from characters to factors. A new variable called “histology” was created to group the histologies based on ICD-O-3 codes into the following four categories: Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, and Not otherwise specified. The ICD-O-3 codes were grouped based on the categories cited by Ganti et al (8). To ensure the variable was correctly coded, a summary table was created that contained the total number of observations per ICD code grouped by histology."

The head() and tail() functions were used to view the top and bottom of the dataset. Based on the top and bottom of the dataset, there appears to be no irregularities. The str() function was used to view the variables and identify any abnormal variables.\nThe key variables of interest (race/ethnicity, survival months, sex, histology, and stage at diagnosis) were closely examined. The table() function was used to check the categorical variables. To check numerical variables, the summary() function was used and a histogram was plotted. The proportions of missing values were calculated.\nTo clean the data, observations with missing survival data and observations with race/ethnicity listed as “Non-Hispanic Unknown Race” were excluded."
