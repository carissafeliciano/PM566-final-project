    "text": "Introduction\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the U.S., with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80-85% of cases. While several studies have investigated racial/ethnic disparities among all lung cancer patients, there is limited data characterizing racial/ethnic disparities among young NSCLC patients (aged ≤50 years). This project evaluated whether survival time was associated with race/ethnicity among young adults aged 18-50 years with NSCLC. Additionally, this project aimed to determine whether any differences in survival across the racial/ethnic groups could be attributed to differences in the frequency distributions of sex, stage at diagnosis, and histological diagnosis. This project utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 17 Database. This project included patients aged 18 to 50 years who were diagnosed in California with first primary NSCLC between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021 (n = 4384). Individuals with missing survival data and missing race/ethnicity data were excluded from the analyses.\nThe full report can be downloaded here.\nInstructions on how to access the SEER-17 dataset can be found here.\n\n\nInteractive Visualizations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots display the distribution of survival times for each racial/ethnic group. The line within each box represents the median survival time. The upper bound of the box represents the 75th percentile (Q3), and the lower bound of the box represents the 25th percentile (Q1). The upper whisker (maximum) is the highest value within 1.5*IQR of Q3, and the lower whisker (minimum) is the lowest value within 1.5*IQR of Q1. Points outside the whiskers represent outliers. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nThe median survival time was lowest for the NHB group (11.0 months) and highest for the NHAIAN group (21.5 months). The median survival time was similar for the NHW (19 months), Hispanic (18 months), and NHAPI (19 months) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time by race/ethnicity and sex. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs). NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nThe median survival time of NHB females (12 months) was significantly lower than that of NHW (21 months), Hispanic (21 months), and NHAPI (25 months) females. Similarly, the median survival time of NHB males (10 months) was significantly lower than that of NHW (17 months), Hispanic (14 months), and NHAPI (15 months) males.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time by race/ethnicity and stage at diagnosis. Error bars represent 95% CIs. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nAmong patients with localized cancer at diagnosis, NHB patients had a lower median survival time (43.5 months) than NHW (57.5 months), NHAPI (51 months), and NHAIAN (75 months) patients. However, these differences were not statistically significant as the 95% CIs overlapped. The median survival time for Hispanic patients (40.5 months) was similar to that of NHB patients (43.5 months). Among patients with regional cancer at diagnosis, NHB patients had a lower median survival time (23 months) than NHW (35.5 months), Hispanic (31 months), and NHAPI (45 months) patients. These differences were not statistically significant. Among patients with distant cancer at diagnosis, the median survival time of NHB patients (6 months) was significantly lower than that of NHW (10 months), Hispanic (12 months), and NHAPI (16 months) patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure displays the median survival time by race/ethnicity and histological diagnosis. Error bars represent 95% CIs. NHW, non-Hispanic White; NHB, non-Hispanic Black; Hispanic, Hispanic all races; NHAPI, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander; NHAIAN, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native.\nAmong patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, NHB patients had a statistically significantly lower median survival (11 months) than NHW (16 months), Hispanic (16 months), and NHAPI (21 months) patients. Among patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, NHB patients had a lower median survival (10 months) than NHW (13.5 months) and NHAPI (11.5 months). However, this difference was not statistically significant. Among patients with a histological diagnosis of NOS, NHB patients (12.5 months) had a statistically significantly lower median survival than NHW (37.5 months) and Hispanic (30 months). NHB patients had a lower median survival (12.5 months) than NHAPI patients (18.5 months) as well, but this difference appeared to be not statistically significant. Less than 3% of patients from each group were diagnosed with large cell carcinoma. The small sample size of this subgroup limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions, as reflected by the wide 95% CIs."

    "text": "Data Acquisition and Wrangling\nThe data was extracted from the SEER-17 database, which covers approximately 26.5% of the US population (6). The SEER Stat program was used to access the SEER-17 dataset. The SEER Stat program was used to filter for cases that met the following criteria: incident diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021, aged 18 to 50 years at the time of diagnosis, first primary malignancy, and diagnosed in California.\nThe SEER 17 dataset includes cancer cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2021. Our analysis was restricted to cases diagnosed between 2011 and 2021 to ensure the evidence was relatively recent and relevant. Cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were identified using primary site codes and histology ICD-O-3 codes, as described by Hansen et al. and Ganti et al., respectively (7, 8). The primary site codes were C34.0 (Main bronchus), C34.1 (Upper lobe, lung), C34.2 (Middle lobe, lung), C34.3 (Lower lobe, lung), C34.8 (Overlapping lesion of lung), and C34.9 (Lung, NOS). The histology ICD-O-3 codes are listed below.\nHistology ICD-O-3 codes included by category:\\ - Squamous cell carcinoma: 8051–8052, 8070-8076, 8078, 8083-8084, 8090, 8094, 8123 \\ - Adenocarcinoma: 8015, 8050, 8140-8141, 8143-8145, 8147, 8190, 8201, 8211, 8250-8255, 8260, 8290, 8310, 8320, 8323, 8333, 8401, 8440, 8470-8471, 8480-8481, 8490, 8503, 8507, 8550, 8570-8572, 8574, 8576 \\ - Large cell carcinoma: 8012–8014, 8021, 8034, 8082 \\ - Not otherwise specified: 8046, 8003–8004, 8022, 8030, 8031-8033, 8035, 8120, 8200, 8240–8241, 8243–8246, 8249, 8430, 8525, 8560, 8562, 8575\nUsing the SEER Stat program, 40 variables were extracted, including demographics, staging, treatment, and survival. The resulting dataset was exported from the SEER Stat program as a csv file and then uploaded into R. Once in R, seven variables relevant to the primary question were selected: “Age recode with single ages and 90+”, “Year of diagnosis”, Sex”, “Race and origin recode (NHW, NHB, NHAIAN, NHAPI, Hispanic)”, “Histologic Type ICD-O-3”, “Combined Summary Stage (2004+)”, and “Survival months”.\nThe key variables were renamed to streamline coding. The survival months, age, and ICD-O-3 variables were converted from characters to integers. Prior to converting the age variable, the text “years” was removed from each value. The “race and origin” variable was converted from characters to factors. A new variable called “histology” was created to group the histologies based on ICD-O-3 codes into the following four categories: Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma, Large cell carcinoma, and Not otherwise specified. The ICD-O-3 codes were grouped based on the categories cited by Ganti et al (8). To ensure the variable was correctly coded, a summary table was created that contained the total number of observations per ICD code grouped by histology."

The SEER database includes information on patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and vital statistics. The SEER Research Plus and NCCR Database includes data from 1975-2021.\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the US, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 80-85% of cases (1). Lung cancer in young adults, defined here as age ≤50 years, is relatively rare. From 2014-2018, 7.2% of incident lung cancer cases were in adults less than 55 years of age (2). Studies have suggested that young patients with non-small cell lung cancer have different clinical and pathologic characteristics compared to older patients, such as a higher proportion of adenocarcinoma, higher prevalence of targetable driver mutations, and better prognosis (3,4). While several studies have investigated racial/ethnic disparities among all lung cancer patients, there is limited data characterizing racial/ethnic disparities among young NSCLC patients (aged ≤50 years) (5).\nThe primary questions of interest: Is survival time associated with race/ethnicity among young adults (age 18-50) with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? If so, can differences in the frequency distributions of sex, histologic subtype, and stage at diagnosis explain any differences in survival across the racial/ethnic groups?"
